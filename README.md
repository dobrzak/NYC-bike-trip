# NYC Bike Trip data analysis

## Project overview
The goal of the project was to analyze the last month data and address the following points:
*  The manager wants to add insurance coverage for the rides that last more than 30 minutes
    *  How many trips would be covered?
    *  If we could charge 0.2 USD for each ride that takes longer than 30 minutes, how much revenue could we expect?
*  The manager wants to understand the travel distance in distance buckets (0-1,2-4,4-9,10+). Please make a diagram.

## Outcomes
### There are 4473 trips which takes longer than 30 minuts in the last month
### If we charge 0.2 USD for each trip over 30minuts we would have expected revenue of 954 USD
### Please refer to the jupyter notebook to refer to the histogram of distances in the buckets
